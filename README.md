# Personal React Portfolio

## Description

This is a personal portfolio for Caleb Colangelo, a front end web developer!

## Usage

Navigate to my portfolio website by following the link here, to my deployed application:


## Features

This portfolio has multiple sections, the first being the 'home' page. On that page I make a brief introduction of myself, and show some pictures of my pets!  
The next pages is my 'about me', where I go a little more in depth about who I am, what I do, and where I excel.  
This app also features a 'portfolio' page, that shows just a few of the projects I have worked on, with links to each of their GitHub repositories.  
There is also a 'contact' page, which allows anyone who would like to reach out to me for ANY reason, to send me a message, and recieve an email back! 
Lastly, the 'resume'. Clicking the 'resume' tab will open another tab off of my react site, and into Google drive where my resume is located.
